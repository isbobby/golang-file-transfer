# Golang File Transfer

## Dependencies
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)<br>
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)<br>
[Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)<br>

## Running Commands With Script
In root directory, give script execution rights `sudo chmod +x k8_helper.sh`

Set up cluster, create images and containers by running `./k8_helper.sh setup`

View logs generated by both sender and receiver container, run `./k8_helper.sh logs`

Delete containers and images, run `./k8_helper.sh clean`

## Verify file transfer
The sender will send the file named 'data' under /sender. The max fiel size is kept at 4kb (4096 bytes).<br>

File transfer happens on container creation, after running `./k8_helper.sh setup`.<br>

Verify file is transfered to the other container by viewing logs via `./k8_helper.sh logs`, or connect to the receiver container via SSH. The received file will be saved under the receiver root directory and named 'received'

## Final clean up
Stop minikube with `minikube stop`<br>
Delete minikube instance from your docker with `minikube delete`
